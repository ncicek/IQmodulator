# IQmodulator

A low cost FPGA-based platform for generating RF signals.
It is implemented with more discrete components than a typical SDR with an "all in one" RF transceiver chip. For example the quadrature double-balanced mixer uses hand-wound trifilar transformers.
 As such, it is intended as a learning platform to show the individual components at play.
